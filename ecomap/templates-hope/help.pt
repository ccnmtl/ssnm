			    <p><b>Navigating your courses and maps</b></p>

                <p>To use the HOPE-NY Community Map tool, you will need to log in with your UNI and password or a username and password given to you by your professor.</p>
                <p>Once you have logged in, you will be taken to your list of courses, or, if you are only in one course you will be taken directly to that course.</p>
                <p>To view your Social Support Network Maps for a course, click the "View Maps" link next to the course.  To return to your list of courses, click the "My Courses" link in the top navigation bar or click on the logo at the top of the page.</p>
                <p>In a course, you may create as many maps as you would like.  To create your first map, click the link to create one.  If you have already created a map, click the "Create New" button in the upper right of the page.</p>
                <p>To view a map you have created, click on the Subject Name.</p>
                <p>To delete a map, click the checkbox next to the map or maps you wish to delete and click the "Delete Selected" button.  You will be warned that your map(s) will be deleted.</p>
                <p><br/></p>

                <p><b>Working with a HOPE-NY Community Map</b></p>

                <p>When you create a new HOPE-NY Community Map, it will be a blank canvas for you to work with.</p>
                <p>You can change the description by clicking on the text "Enter Description here" and replacing it with your description.  There will be a box around the description to let you know you are editing it.</p>
                <p>To change the subject name, click on the text "Enter Subject Name Here" and replace it the same way.</p>
                <p><br/></p>

                <p><b>Working with People</b></p>

                <p>To add a person to the map, click and drag a support level icon from the step 1 area to a location on the map and release the mouse button.  You can change the position of the person by dragging the person to another location.</p>
                <p>To change the name of a person, click on the text of the name and replace it.  If you are having trouble, you may need to click toward the top of the person box when the cursor looks like an I beam.</p>
                <p>To change the support level of a person, move the mouse over the left side of the person box.  Icons for the other levels will appear.  Click on the icon of the level you want.</p>
                <p>To delete a person, drag the person to the Trash icon.</p>
                <p><br/></p>

                <p><b>Working with Support Types</b></p>

                <p>You can add multiple support types to a person.  To add a support type, click and drag the letter icon next to the support type you wish to add and drop it on the person.  If you are having trouble, you may need to drop it near the middle of the person box.</p>
                <p>To remove a support type, click and drag the letter icon from the person to an empty area of the map.  The other support type icons will rearrange themselves.</p>
                <p><br/></p>

                <p><b>Saving your map</b></p>

                <p>You can save your map at any time by clicking the "Save Changes" button.  You will see a message at the top of your map indicating that your changes have been saved.</p>
                <p>To return to your list of maps, click the "&lt;&lt; Back to List" button.  If you haven't saved your changes, you will be prompted to save or discard your changes.</p>
                <p><br/></p>

                <p><b>Customizing your map</b></p>

                <p>You can customize some of the aspects of your map.  To increase the size of a circle, click and drag the right side of the circle to the right.  To decrease the size, drag to the left.</p>
                <p>You can rename the support levels and support types by clicking on the text and replacing it.  There will be a box around the text to let you know you are editing it.</p>
