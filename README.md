SSNM
==========
The Social Support Network Map was created in 2005 as a collaboration with Professor Susan Witte at the School of Social Work as an interactive learning tool for classroom instruction.

The SSNM is a simple web-based tool intended for use by social workers and other human service, health or mental health workers in support of clients or community members. The tool was evolved from early versions of paper-based social network and ecomapping tools. The purpose of the tool is to identify and graphically illustrate the informal social supports in a personâ€™s network either in general, or specifically related to an issue for work, like gaining employment, or housing, or getting into recovery, for example.

This Django project was deprecated March 2018, and is not actively maintained.

A sustainable, static site was developed in Hugo to house the content and activities. Visit the new SSNM at ssnm.ctl.columbia.edu.
